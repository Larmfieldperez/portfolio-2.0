      <span>Hey I'm Laura, a full stack software engineer!</span>

      <br/>
      My road to code started when I was 15, but I took a detour in college and rediscovered it after graduating. I got back into coding as a fun and creative way to exercise my brain and ended up realizing I actually have a passion for programming so when I stumbled upon Fullstack Academy's Grace Hopper Program I decided to make a 180 from psychology research into tech and I have no regrets.

      You can always find me hanging out with my dog, but when I'm not coding (and quarantine is over) you can find me at soulcycle, and/or exploring the restaurants of New York City with friends.
